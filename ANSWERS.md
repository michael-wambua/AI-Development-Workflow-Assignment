# Hospital AI System for Patient Readmission Risk Prediction

## 1. Problem Scope (5 points)

**Problem Definition:** Develop an AI system to predict the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days of discharge to enable proactive interventions and improve patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.

**Objectives:**
- Primary: Achieve 85% accuracy in predicting 30-day readmission risk
- Secondary: Reduce overall readmission rates by 15% through early intervention
- Tertiary: Optimize resource allocation for discharge planning and follow-up care

**Stakeholders:**
- **Primary:** Patients (beneficiaries of improved care), physicians and nurses (end users), hospital administrators (decision makers)
- **Secondary:** Insurance companies (cost implications), regulatory bodies (compliance oversight), IT department (system integration)
- **Tertiary:** Family members (care coordination), community healthcare providers (continuity of care)

## 2. Data Strategy (10 points)

**Proposed Data Sources:**
- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** Diagnosis codes, medication history, lab results, vital signs, procedure codes
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, socioeconomic status, insurance type, geographic location
- **Clinical Data:** Length of stay, discharge disposition, comorbidities, severity scores
- **Administrative Data:** Previous admissions, emergency department visits, outpatient visits
- **Social Determinants:** Housing stability, transportation access, social support systems

**Two Ethical Concerns:**

1. **Patient Privacy and Data Security:** Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive medical information during data collection, storage, and model training. Personal health information could be exposed through data breaches or inadequate anonymization techniques.

2. **Algorithmic Bias and Health Equity:** Potential for the model to perpetuate existing healthcare disparities by unfairly targeting certain demographic groups (race, socioeconomic status, insurance type) with higher predicted readmission risks, leading to differential treatment or resource allocation.

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicates, handle missing values using median imputation for numerical and mode imputation for categorical variables
- **Feature Engineering:** Create derived features such as comorbidity scores, medication complexity index, days since last admission, and interaction terms between age and chronic conditions
- **Normalization:** Apply standard scaling to numerical features and one-hot encoding to categorical variables
- **Feature Selection:** Use correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination to identify most predictive variables
- **Data Splitting:** Implement stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across risk categories in training, validation, and test sets

## 3. Model Development (10 points)

**Selected Model:** Random Forest Classifier

**Justification:**
Random Forest is optimal for this healthcare application because it handles mixed data types effectively, provides feature importance rankings for clinical interpretation, reduces overfitting through ensemble methods, and offers robust performance with missing values. It also provides probability estimates for risk stratification and maintains good interpretability for healthcare professionals.

**Performance Calculations:**
- **Precision:** 25/(25+50) = 0.33 or 33%
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** 25/(25+75) = 0.25 or 25%
- **Specificity:** 850/(850+50) = 0.94 or 94%
- **Overall Accuracy:** (850+25)/(850+50+75+25) = 0.875 or 87.5%

## 4. Deployment (10 points)

**Integration Steps:**
1. **System Architecture Design:** Develop RESTful API endpoints for model inference integrated with existing hospital information systems
2. **Real-time Data Pipeline:** Establish automated data extraction from EHR systems with real-time preprocessing capabilities
3. **User Interface Development:** Create dashboard for clinicians showing risk scores, contributing factors, and recommended interventions
4. **Pilot Testing:** Implement controlled rollout in one department before hospital-wide deployment
5. **Staff Training:** Conduct comprehensive training sessions for healthcare providers on system interpretation and workflow integration
6. **Monitoring Framework:** Establish continuous performance monitoring with automated alerts for model drift or system failures

**HIPAA Compliance Measures:**
- **Data Encryption:** Implement end-to-end encryption for all data transmission and storage using AES-256 standards
- **Access Controls:** Deploy role-based authentication with multi-factor verification and audit logging of all system access
- **De-identification:** Apply safe harbor method for removing direct identifiers and statistical disclosure control techniques
- **Business Associate Agreements:** Establish formal agreements with all third-party vendors handling protected health information
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct quarterly security assessments and annual compliance reviews with documentation of all procedures
- **Incident Response:** Maintain comprehensive breach notification procedures meeting 60-day reporting requirements

## 5. Optimization (5 points)

**Method to Address Overfitting: Cross-Validation with Regularization**

Implement k-fold cross-validation (k=5) combined with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model complexity. This approach involves systematically varying the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf while monitoring performance across multiple validation folds. Additionally, incorporate early stopping mechanisms that halt training when validation performance plateaus, preventing the model from memorizing training data patterns that don't generalize to new patients. This method ensures robust performance across diverse patient populations while maintaining clinical relevance and interpretability.
